Introduction

 The coursework assignment is an individual assessment weighted 40% of the marks for the module. It is designed mainly to assess students’ practical problem-solving skills and critical thinking/evaluation on the design and development of database systems. It requires the student to analyse, design and implement a web-based database application based on a given business case study. You are asked to provide a software solution as well as appropriate documentation detailing the design and implementation of the system.
1Case Study - Online Library Management System
MediCare Pvt Ltd is a medium-sized private healthcare provider in Sri Lanka. They manage several clinics and medical centers that offer services in areas such as general medicine, pediatrics, cardiology, and dermatology. Currently, patients book appointments via phone calls or by visiting the clinics physically, which often leads to long waiting times, booking errors, and difficulty in managing patient records.
To improve efficiency and provide better patient care, the management has decided to develop an Online Healthcare Appointment System.
